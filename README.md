# Huddle-Bootstrap-Version

# Project Description
This project aims to showcase my basic skills in responsive design using Bootstrap component framework.

The Projwct has 'Container' then a 'grid system container' (row) embedded within it. There were two columns nested within the 'grid system container'.

The first column was spanned to 7 columns from medium devices, it consists heading and demonstration image.

The second column spanned to 5 columns from mediun devices, it consists advertisement note, and button that will redirect the client to registration page.

There are some attributes that were not documented in Bootstrap. Nontheless, I managed custom css sheet to apply them and used Bootstrap classes to control them.
there is a background-color and background-image in 'container' and 'row' respectively, the font-family used was 'Open sans', sans-serif' and the font-weight used was 600, 400, 200. and I used 14px, 15px, and 16px as font-sizes accrossed the entire project. The colors used was hsl(0,0%,100%); hsl(257, 40%, 49%). 
the expected outcome of the project can be found in images folder
